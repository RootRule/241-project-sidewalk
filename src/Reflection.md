# Reflection

### Declare/discuss any aspects of your code that are not working.
- **What are your intuitions about why they are not working?**
- **Acknowledge and discuss any parts of the program that appear to be inefficient.**

Everything seems to be working.

### What are some of the most important lessons you learned while working on this assignment? 
- **Why do you think so?**

Practicing understanding and finishing someone else's code is important for me because in the basic cs classes I've mostly written my own simpler code from scratch. In order to work on anything practical, that's an important skill.

Learning to work without an auto-grading tester and the level of certainty I normally get from that is also more practical.

### What was the most challenging aspect of this assignment? 
- **Why?**

Writing the testers was the most difficult for me just because it was the most different from what we've been doing in this class assignment and labs and it's been a while since I've had create my own testers. Also I'm just still not the best at knowing what amount of tests is the correct amount.
